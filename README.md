# Reverse Grief - Lethal Company Mod

Tired of griefers ruining your `Lethal Company` game experience? The `Reverse-Grief Lethal Company Mod` is here to level the playing field. This mod ensures that any damage inflicted by a griefer is reflected back onto them, promoting fair play and discouraging harmful behavior.

Griefing has no place in a cooperative game like `Lethal Company`. This mod not only prevents frustrating gameplay but also teaches griefers a lesson in teamwork.

## Why?

- Ensures that griefers receive an immediate consequence for their actions.
- Maintains the core game difficulty and does not give any unfair advantage to players (you'll still feel the hit if someone is hitting you with a shovel to save you from suffocating).

## Install

- Ensure you have [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) installed for `Lethal Company`.
- Download [`LCModReverseGrief.dll`](https://github.com/YourGitHub/reverse-grief-lethal-company-mod/releases) and place it in `$YOUR_GAME_FOLDER\BepInEx\plugins\LCModReverseGrief.dll`.
